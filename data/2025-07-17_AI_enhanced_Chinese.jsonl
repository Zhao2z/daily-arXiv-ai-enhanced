Architectural patterns and\nstrategies can provide reusable knowledge and best practices to engineer\nquantum software systems effectively and efficiently. However, quantum software\npractitioners face significant challenges in selecting and implementing\nappropriate patterns and strategies due to the complexity of quantum software\nsystems and the lack of guidelines. To address these challenges, this study\nproposes decision models for selecting patterns and strategies in six critical\ndesign areas in quantum software systems: Communication, Decomposition, Data\nProcessing, Fault Tolerance, Integration and Optimization, and Algorithm\nImplementation. These decision models are constructed based on data collected\nfrom both a mining study (i.e., GitHub and Stack Exchange) and a Systematic\nLiterature Review, which were used to identify relevant patterns and strategies\nwith their involved Quality Attributes (QAs). We then conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 16 quantum software practitioners to evaluate the familiarity,\nunderstandability, completeness, and usefulness of the proposed decision\nmodels. The results show that the proposed decision models can aid\npractitioners in selecting suitable patterns and strategies to address the\nchallenges related to the architecture design of quantum software systems.

Even though mutation\nscheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers\nhave primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation\nscheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing\nframework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and\nhybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a\nhierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid\ninitial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select\nhigh-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that\nsimultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation\nscheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an\nevolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator\nprobabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to\nescape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage\nand vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage\nand 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities\nacross diverse categories.

However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic\nInformation Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract\nessential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from\nSaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,\nencompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's\neffectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,\nchallenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic\ncontent. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing\ntransformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for\nimproved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing\nlandscape.

SWE-Perf\ncomprises 140 carefully curated instances, each derived from\nperformance-improving pull requests from popular GitHub repositories. Each\nbenchmark instance includes the relevant codebase, target functions,\nperformance-related tests, expert-authored patches, and executable\nenvironments. Through a comprehensive evaluation of representative methods that\nspan file-level and repo-level approaches (e.g., Agentless and OpenHands), we\nreveal a substantial capability gap between existing LLMs and expert-level\noptimization performance, highlighting critical research opportunities in this\nemerging field.", "AI": {"tldr": "SWE-Perf\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b140\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SWE-Perf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b140\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE-Perf\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}
