These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code\npatterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program\nelements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,\nsuch as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models\nability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,\na high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on\nfundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning\ndata dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs\nwritten in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning\ncomplexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects\ntargets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.\nWe evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at\nidentifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative\nanalyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and\nbackward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code\nreasoning capabilities."}

To these ends, both academia and\nindustry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools\nto deal with these challenges.

However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in\nboth industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such\nas code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of\nsubjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nevaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized,\nreproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to\nmeasure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s\ninterpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were\ntested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier\nnames with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each\nintervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response\nvariability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The\nresults showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with\nagreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and\nrefactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity\nthat the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs\nreasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each\nintervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to\n14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating\nresponse oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical\nsignificance of the results.

To support the\nidentification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have\nbeen developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the\nnon-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social\nscientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement\nelicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has\naddressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative\nrequirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal\nmethods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal\nverification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users.

Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We\nconducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a\nrandom search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks.

The root cause is\nthat we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes\nchallenges in the explainability of the results.\n  In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by\ncausally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn\nrules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify\nthem with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated\nreflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these\nplaces in the landscape.
