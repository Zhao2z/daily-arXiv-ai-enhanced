In this\ncontext, various formats of collaborative development workflows using Git have\nemerged and gained popularity among software engineers. We can categorize such\nworkflows into two main types: branch-based workflows and trunk-based\nworkflows. Branch-based workflows typically define a set of remote branches\nwith well-defined objectives, such as feature branches, a branch for feature\nintegration, and a main branch. The goal is to migrate changes from the most\nisolated branch to the main one shared by all as the code matures. In this\ncategory, GitFlow stands out as the most popular example. In contrast,\ntrunk-based workflows have a single remote branch where developers integrate\ntheir changes directly. In this range of options, choosing a workflow that\nmaximizes team productivity while promoting software quality becomes a\nnon-trivial task. Despite discussions on forums, social networks, and blogs,\nfew scientific articles have explored this topic. In this work, we provide\nevidence on how Brazilian developers work with Git workflows and what factors\nfavor or hinder the use of each model. To this end, we conducted\nsemi-structured interviews and a survey with software developers. Our results\nindicate that trunk-based development favors fast-paced projects with\nexperienced and smaller teams, while branch-based development suits less\nexperienced and larger teams better, despite posing management challenges."}

This evolution has spurred the emergence of\nnumerous start-ups that now face challenges traditionally encountered by\nestablished aerospace companies. Among these challenges is the efficient\nprocessing of digital intra-device communication interfaces for onboard\nequipment - a critical component for ensuring seamless system integration and\nfunctionality. Addressing this challenge requires solutions that emphasize\nclear and consistent interface descriptions, automation of processes, and\nreduced labor-intensive efforts.\n  This paper presents a novel process and toolchain designed to streamline the\ndevelopment of digital interfaces and onboard software, which our team has\nsuccessfully applied in several completed projects. The proposed approach\nfocuses on automation and flexibility while maintaining compliance with design\nassurance requirements."}

However, manually writing high-quality\nSVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone. To bridge this gap, we propose\nAssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates\nhigh-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications.\nAssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous\nspecification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set\nof dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned\nwith signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive\nassertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The\nframework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion\nquality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions.\nExperimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL)\ndesigns demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average\nincrease of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art approaches."}

Since generated source code\nis virtually impossible to distinguish from manually written code, their\nreal-world usage and impact on open-source software development remain poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we introduce the concept of self-admitted GenAI\nusage, that is, developers explicitly referring to the use of GenAI tools for\ncontent creation in software artifacts. Using this concept as a lens to study\nhow GenAI tools are integrated into open-source software projects, we analyze a\ncurated sample of more than 250,000 GitHub repositories, identifying 1,292 such\nself-admissions across 156 repositories in commit messages, code comments, and\nproject documentation. Using a mixed methods approach, we derive a taxonomy of\n32 tasks, 10 content types, and 11 purposes associated with GenAI usage based\non 284 qualitatively coded mentions. We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development. Finally,\nwe examine the longitudinal impact of GenAI adoption on code churn in 151\nrepositories with self-admitted GenAI usage and find no general increase,\ncontradicting popular narratives on the impact of GenAI on software\ndevelopment."}
