Method: 从德国开发者论坛提取5,949条语句，由四名德语母语学生基于Shaver情感模型标注六种基本情感。

Result: 标注过程显示高一致性和可靠性，验证了数据集的有效性，并揭示了德语软件工程领域工具的不足。

Conclusion: 该数据集为德语开发者社区提供了可靠的情感分析资源，并提出了优化标注和扩展应用的思路。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential technique for investigating the emotional
climate within developer teams, contributing to both team productivity and
project success. Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering
primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this
gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements,
extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was
annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver
et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the
annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These
results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support
sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.
Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of
domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches
to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.

### [2] [Automatic Generation of Explainability Requirements and Software Explanations From User Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07344)
*Martin Obaidi,Jannik Fischbach,Jakob Droste,Hannah Deters,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Steffen Krätzig,Hugo Villamizar,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化工具支持的方法，用于从用户反馈中提取可解释性需求并生成对应解释，评估显示AI生成的需求在相关性上不如人工，但解释更受青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强透明度、建立用户信任和确保法规合规性是可解释性的关键需求，但目前缺乏系统化方法将用户反馈转化为结构化需求和解释。

Method: 引入一种工具支持的方法，自动从用户评论中提取需求并生成解释，通过工业合作数据集评估效果。

Result: AI生成的需求在相关性和正确性上不如人工，但其生成的解释在清晰度和风格上更受青睐。正确性仍需人工验证。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了软件系统中可解释性需求的研究，提供了自动化方法、实证见解和公开数据集。

Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance
transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However,
translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured
requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing
methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no
established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating
aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a
tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to
create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted
explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while
AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to
human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for
their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,
highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the
advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)
introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and
generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the
strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)
releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic
generation of explainability requirements.

Abstract: The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into engineering workflows is an
essential step toward automating and optimizing plant and process engineering
processes. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) serves as a key enabler for
creating interoperable Digital Twins that facilitate engineering data exchange
and automation. This paper explores the use of AAS within engineering
workflows, particularly in combination with Business Process Model and Notation
(BPMN) to define structured and automated processes. We propose a distributed
AAS copy-on-write infrastructure that enhances security and scalability while
enabling seamless cross organizational collaboration. We also introduce a
workflow management prototype automating AAS operations and engineering
workflows, improving efficiency and traceability.

### [4] [From Requirements to Code: Understanding Developer Practices in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07548)
*Jonathan Ullrich,Matthias Koch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了开发者如何利用需求文档和设计工件为LLMs生成代码提供输入，发现需求文档过于抽象，需分解为编程任务并补充设计决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能终结传统软件工程，以及开发者如何利用需求文档为LLMs生成代码。

Method: 采访了14家公司的18名从业者，分析其使用需求文档和设计工件的方式。

Result: 需求文档需手动分解为编程任务并补充设计决策，才能有效用于LLMs。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs生成代码时，基础的需求工程工作仍不可或缺。

Abstract: With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation
capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software
engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on
the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this
vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate
requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely
unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how
they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed
LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that
explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our
theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract
for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed
into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and
architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights
that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate
code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to
automating requirements-centric SE tasks.

### [5] [Prompt Engineering for Requirements Engineering: A Literature Review and Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07682)
*Kaicheng Huang,Fanyu Wang,Yutan Huang,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向路线图的系统文献综述（PE4RE），分析了35项研究，提出了混合分类法，并指出了当前局限与研究空白，最后提出了从临时原型到可重复工作流程的路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）在需求工程（RE）任务中存在不确定性和不可控性，缺乏有效的提示工程（PE）指导，阻碍了其可信应用。

Method: 采用Kitchenham和Petersen的二次研究协议，搜索了六个数字图书馆，筛选了867条记录，分析了35项主要研究，提出了混合分类法。

Result: 研究揭示了任务、LLM家族和提示类型的映射关系，并指出了当前局限与研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出了从临时原型到可重复工作流程的路线图，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt
engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering
(RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant
uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on
how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy
implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented
systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following
Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital
libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring
order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links
technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented
RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with
five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt
types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we
outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can
evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.

### [6] [From Domain Documents to Requirements: Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Space Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07689)
*Chetan Arora,Fanyu Wang,Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn,Aldeida Aleti,Shaun Kenyon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用检索增强生成（RAG）模型在太空领域半自动化生成需求的潜力，通过AI驱动的方法减少人工工作量并提高需求覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太空行业的需求工程复杂且高精度要求高，小型机构难以从大量非结构化文档中提取可操作需求。

Method: 采用模块化AI方法，预处理文档、分类、检索相关内容，并利用大语言模型生成需求草案。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法能减少人工工作量，提高需求覆盖率，并支持轻量级合规对齐。

Conclusion: 论文提出了AI在需求工程中更广泛应用的路线图，旨在降低小型机构参与大型关键任务的门槛。

Abstract: Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex,
demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability
to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants
often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured
documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory
standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate
requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven
approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into
semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content
from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language
models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the
space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in
collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our
preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,
improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance
alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE
workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate
in large-scale, safety-critical missions.
