*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Elisa Schmid,Raymond Ochsner,Kurt Schneider,Jil Klünder*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个针对德语开发者论坛的情感分析数据集，填补了现有工具在德语软件工程领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析工具主要基于英语或非德语数据集，缺乏对德语开发者社区的支持。

Method: 从德语开发者论坛提取5,949条语句，由四名德语母语学生基于Shaver情感模型进行六种基本情感的标注。

Result: 标注过程显示出高评分者一致性和可靠性，验证了数据集的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了德语软件工程领域情感分析的空白，并讨论了优化标注和进一步应用的途径。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential technique for investigating the emotional
climate within developer teams, contributing to both team productivity and
project success. Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering
primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this
gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements,
extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was
annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver
et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the
annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These
results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support
sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.
Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of
domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches
to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.

### [2] [Automatic Generation of Explainability Requirements and Software Explanations From User Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07344)
*Martin Obaidi,Jannik Fischbach,Jakob Droste,Hannah Deters,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Steffen Krätzig,Hugo Villamizar,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化工具，用于从用户反馈中提取可解释性需求并生成对应解释，评估显示AI生成的需求准确性不足，但解释的清晰度更受青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强透明度、建立用户信任和确保合规性需要可解释性，但现有方法无法系统地将用户反馈转化为结构化需求和解释。

Method: 引入工具支持的自动化方法，从用户评论中提取需求并生成解释，通过工业合作数据集评估效果。

Result: AI生成的需求常缺乏相关性和正确性，但生成的解释在清晰度和风格上更受青睐，正确性仍需人工验证。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了软件系统可解释性需求的自动化生成，并提供了相关数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance
transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However,
translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured
requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing
methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no
established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating
aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a
tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to
create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted
explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while
AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to
human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for
their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,
highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the
advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)
introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and
generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the
strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)
releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic
generation of explainability requirements.

Abstract: The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into engineering workflows is an
essential step toward automating and optimizing plant and process engineering
processes. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) serves as a key enabler for
creating interoperable Digital Twins that facilitate engineering data exchange
and automation. This paper explores the use of AAS within engineering
workflows, particularly in combination with Business Process Model and Notation
(BPMN) to define structured and automated processes. We propose a distributed
AAS copy-on-write infrastructure that enhances security and scalability while
enabling seamless cross organizational collaboration. We also introduce a
workflow management prototype automating AAS operations and engineering
workflows, improving efficiency and traceability.

### [4] [From Requirements to Code: Understanding Developer Practices in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07548)
*Jonathan Ullrich,Matthias Koch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了开发者如何利用需求文档和其他设计工件为LLMs生成代码提供输入，发现需求文档通常过于抽象，需手动分解为编程任务并补充设计决策和架构约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式LLMs是否可能终结传统软件工程，通过研究开发者如何将需求融入LLMs的代码生成过程。

Method: 访谈了来自14家公司的18名从业者，分析其如何利用需求和设计工件为LLMs生成代码。

Result: 需求文档通常过于抽象，需分解为编程任务并补充设计决策和架构约束才能用于LLMs。

Conclusion: 即使使用LLMs生成代码，基础的需求工程工作仍不可或缺，研究为自动化需求为中心的SE任务提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation
capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software
engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on
the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this
vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate
requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely
unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how
they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed
LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that
explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our
theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract
for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed
into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and
architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights
that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate
code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to
automating requirements-centric SE tasks.

### [5] [Prompt Engineering for Requirements Engineering: A Literature Review and Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07682)
*Kaicheng Huang,Fanyu Wang,Yutan Huang,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种面向路线图的系统文献综述方法（PE4RE），通过混合分类法将提示工程技术（如few-shot、Chain-of-Thought）与需求工程任务（如获取、验证、可追溯性）关联，并揭示了当前局限与研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在需求工程（RE）任务中存在不确定性和不可控性，缺乏有效的提示指导，阻碍了其可信赖应用。

Method: 采用Kitchenham和Petersen的二次研究协议，检索六个数字图书馆，筛选867条记录，分析35项主要研究，提出混合分类法。

Result: 揭示了当前PE4RE的任务、LLM家族和提示类型，并指出了局限性与研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出了逐步路线图，将当前的临时PE原型发展为可重复、实用的工作流程。

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt
engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering
(RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant
uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on
how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy
implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented
systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following
Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital
libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring
order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links
technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented
RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with
five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt
types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we
outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can
evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.

### [6] [From Domain Documents to Requirements: Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Space Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07689)
*Chetan Arora,Fanyu Wang,Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn,Aldeida Aleti,Shaun Kenyon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在空间领域使用检索增强生成（RAG）模型支持需求工程的潜力，提出了一种模块化AI方法，初步结果显示能减少人工工作量并提高需求覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间行业的需求工程复杂且高精度要求高，小型组织难以从非结构化文档中提取可操作需求。

Method: 采用RAG模型预处理文档、分类、检索相关内容，并利用大语言模型生成需求草案。

Result: 初步结果表明该方法能减少人工工作，提高需求覆盖率，并支持轻量级合规对齐。

Conclusion: 论文提出了AI在需求工程中更广泛应用的路线图，旨在降低小型组织参与大型任务的壁垒。

Abstract: Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex,
demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability
to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants
often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured
documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory
standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate
requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven
approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into
semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content
from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language
models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the
space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in
collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our
preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,
improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance
alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE
workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate
in large-scale, safety-critical missions.
