Smaller space organisations and new entrants\noften struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured\ndocuments such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory\nstandards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate\nrequirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven\napproach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into\nsemantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content\nfrom domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language\nmodels (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the\nspace domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in\ncollaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our\npreliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,\nimprove coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance\nalignment.
