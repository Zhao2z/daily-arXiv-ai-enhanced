This\nresearch explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources\nthat facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data\nfrom 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising\nclosed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,\nalong with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative\ndata were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses\nunderwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,\nits adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and\nmanaging the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of\ninstitutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty\nare more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer\ncollaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives.

To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques\nunconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers\nthat waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and\ngenerating false positive bug reports.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing\ntechnique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready\nand the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,\ncertifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FMI\u6807\u51c6\u5c06SystemC\u865a\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fd0\u884c\u5e76\u63a5\u6536\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u865a\u62df\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002SystemC\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751fFMI\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u534f\u540c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528FMI\u8fde\u63a5SystemC\u865a\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7FMI\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u83b7\u53d6\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u5e76\u63a5\u6536\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff08\u5982ISO 26262\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86SystemC\u865a\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u878d\u5165\u534f\u540c\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

To\nmitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance\nof widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase\nof WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems.

For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval\ntechniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.\nBased on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both\nRAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with\nsimilarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of\nsimilarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where\nBM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior\nperformance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval\ntechniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.\nFurthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of\nRAG methods in real-world development environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u4fe1\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26RAG\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u800c\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22RAG\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5fae\u4fe1\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26RAG\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd526\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff080.5B-671B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bcd\u6cd5\uff08BM25\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff08GTE-Qwen\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027RAG\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bcd\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
