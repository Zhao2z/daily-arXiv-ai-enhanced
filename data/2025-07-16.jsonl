These reviews also provide\ndevelopers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and\nintroducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of\nreviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related\nconcerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software\nutilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,\nprivacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine\nlearning. Notably, there is a lack of focus on classifying reviews specifically\nas privacy-related feature requests, privacy-related bug reports, or\nprivacy-irrelevant. This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models.

However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries.

Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack.

We address\nfour research questions: i) we assess software practitioners' knowledge of SDs\nand awareness of associated security risks, ii) we investigate their behavior\ntowards SDs, iii) we explore common tools and strategies used to mitigate SDs,\nand iv) we analyze how security risks are communicated within teams and to\ndecision makers. We observe variations in how practitioners perceive and manage\nSDs, with some prioritizing delivery speed over security, while others\nconsistently maintain security as a priority. Our findings emphasize the need\nfor stronger integration of security practices across the Software Development\nLife Cycle (SDLC), more consistent use of mitigation strategies, better\nbalancing of deadlines, resources, and security-related tasks, with attention\nto the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad."}
