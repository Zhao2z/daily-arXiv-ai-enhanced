While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for\nacademic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic.

ITSs also support internal linking\nbetween issues, and external linking to other tools and information sources.\nThis provides SE organisations key forms of documentation, including forwards\nand backwards traceability (e.g., Feature Requests linked to sprint releases\nand code commits linked to Bug Reports). An Issue Tracking Ecosystem (ITE) is\nthe aggregate of the central ITS and the related SE artefacts, stakeholders,\nand processes -- with an emphasis on how these contextual factors interact with\nthe ITS. The quality of ITEs is central to the success of these organisations\nand their software products. There are challenges, however, within ITEs,\nincluding complex networks of interlinked artefacts and diverse workflows.\nWhile ITSs have been the subject of study in SE research for decades, ITEs as a\nwhole need further exploration.\n  In this thesis, I undertake the challenge of understanding ITEs at a broader\nlevel, addressing these questions regarding complexity and diversity. I\ninterviewed practitioners and performed archival analysis on a diverse set of\nITSs. These analyses revealed the context-dependent nature of ITE problems,\nhighlighting the need for context-specific ITE research. While previous work\nhas produced many solutions to specific ITS problems, these solutions are not\nconsistently framed in a context-rich and comparable way, leading to a desire\nfor more aligned solutions across research and practice.

Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts,\nso complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating\nand executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a\ndeveloper's modified version, but fails again after merging with another\ndeveloper's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome\nthese limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on\nCode Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests\nusing different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter\nconfigurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler\nsystems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex,\nreal-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in\ndetecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation\nremains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there\nis promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.\n  --\n  Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\\c{c}as em\numa base de c\\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de\naltera\\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.

They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps,\nwhich act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human\nprogrammers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the\ncorrectness and reliability of the generated code.

This paper empirically explores\nthe external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by\nanalyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation\nbenchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by\nanalyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting\nLLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such\nas unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while\ninternal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even\nwhen CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to\ninstruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with\nflawed CoTs.

As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This\nminimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization\ndirectives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI\ninteractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework\nconsistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich\nand consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic,\nDeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and\nSmall-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a5C Prompt Contract\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c8\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e865C Prompt Contract\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCharacter\u3001Cause\u3001Constraint\u3001Contingency\u548cCalibration\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c5C\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "5C\u6846\u67b6\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
