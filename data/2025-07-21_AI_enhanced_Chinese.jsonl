Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within\ncode samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often\nsignal maintainability decay. These findings underscore the need for\nsocio-technical quality indicators and lightweight governance mechanisms\ntailored to shared instructional artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5f02\u5473\uff08\u5982\u5927\u7c7b\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5dee\uff09\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u5f02\u5473\uff08\u5982\u5b64\u7acb\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u793e\u533a\u95ee\u9898\u5e38\u9884\u793a\u6216\u52a0\u5267\u6280\u672f\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u867d\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u7ba1\u7406\u677e\u6563\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\u4ea4\u7ec7\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u58f0\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u679030\u7bc7\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u548c17\u7bc7\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u5411\u8d44\u6599\uff082013-2024\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u9898\u5408\u6210\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5473\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u5f02\u5473\u5e38\u5148\u4e8e\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u201c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u9759\u9ed8\u201d\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u533a\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u9884\u793a\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u4f53\u5236\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

To ensure that our AI-assisted\nfixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct\nrandomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.\n  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large\nLlama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match\npatch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The\ninternal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP\nfunctions suggested by GPT-4o.\n  Safety Trial.

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6838\u5fc3\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u6ce8\u91cd\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}
